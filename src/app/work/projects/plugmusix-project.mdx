## Overview

In this project, I focused on building a robust platform to connect fans, artists, and music professionals, integrating tools for content promotion and monetization. The goal was to create a seamless experience by developing native mobile applications for Android and iOS alongside a web platform. By leveraging Kotlin, Swift, React, and Node.js, I designed and implemented scalable solutions, including real-time notifications, third-party API integrations (Spotify, Facebook), and analytics tracking with Firebase and Google Analytics.  

This approach significantly enhanced user engagement, streamlined artist-fan interactions, and ensured data-driven decision-making, positioning Plugmusix as the largest music community in Peru with over 10,000 users.  

## Key Features

- **Personalized Concert, Music and Friends Recommendations Algorithm**: Developed a unified recommendation system that combines concert suggestions, artist discovery, and music taste preferences. By analyzing user data from Spotify, listening habits, location, and favorite genres, the algorithm provides highly personalized experiences. It not only suggests concerts but also recommends local Peruvian artists and tracks new music that aligns with users’ unique preferences, ensuring that each user’s feed is tailored to their tastes. This solution drives engagement by connecting fans with the most relevant events, artists, and music.
- **Social Media Feed**: Built a dynamic social feed that allows users to share music, concerts, and recommendations. This feature fostered community engagement, allowing users to interact and stay informed about the latest in music and events.
- **Integrated Ticket and Merchandise Sales Platform (Direct-to-Fan Sales)**: Developed a seamless platform that enables concert producers to sell tickets and artists to offer physical and digital merchandise directly to their fans. This unified system simplifies the purchasing process, allowing users to easily access and buy tickets for their favorite concerts while also purchasing exclusive artist merchandise. By connecting fans with both event access and unique products, this feature enhances fan engagement and provides artists with an additional revenue stream, streamlining the entire fan experience from ticket purchase to merchandise acquisition.
- **Artist Dashboard**: Developed a comprehensive dashboard for artists to track their profile metrics, including concert attendance, merchandise sales, and user interactions. This data-driven tool helps artists make informed decisions to optimize their marketing strategies and grow their fan base more effectively.
- **Chat Feature**: Added a chat functionality that enables users to communicate with other members of the Plugmusix community. Whether it’s discussing music, concerts, or collaborations, this feature fosters direct engagement among users.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin/Java & Swift/SwiftUI**: Used for developing native mobile apps for Android and iOS, ensuring high performance and smooth user experience on both platforms.
- **React & Node.js**:  Utilized for building the web platform, with React for a dynamic user interface and Node.js for handling backend services and real-time communication.
- **Python**: Employed for developing recommendation algorithms, including concert recommendations, artist suggestions, and personalized music tastes, optimizing user engagement and content discovery.
- **Firebase & SendGrid**: Firebase is used for push notifications, real-time analytics, and error management with Crashlytics, while SendGrid handles email delivery, keeping users informed about concerts and updates.
- **AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53 & Cloudflare)**: AWS EC2 is used for deploying and scaling the backend, S3 for storing and distributing static resources like images and tickets, Route 53 for domain management, and Cloudflare enhances platform performance and security with its CDN and DDoS protection.
- **MongoDB**: A flexible, scalable database used to manage users, ticket sales, merchandise, and other platform data.
- **WhatsApp API & Google Analytics**: WhatsApp API enables direct communication with users, while Google Analytics tracks user behavior and provides insights for data-driven decisions.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge in developing Plugmusix was building a personalized recommendation engine by aggregating diverse user data, such as concert history and music preferences. Additionally, integrating features like ticket sales, merchandise, and fan clubs into one cohesive platform required careful coordination. Scaling the platform efficiently using AWS and optimizing performance with Cloudflare were also key to handling high-traffic events smoothly.

## Outcome

The recommendation engine successfully increased user engagement by offering tailored concert and artist suggestions. Integrating ticket and merchandise sales directly into the platform opened new revenue opportunities for artists, while features like real-time notifications, chat, and fan clubs fostered a dynamic user community. The platform now effectively connects fans and artists, streamlining processes and enhancing user experiences.
